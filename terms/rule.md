#### Definitions

*To rule* is to *[create](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/create.md) a [potentially](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/potential.md) [coercive](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/coerce.md) [requirement](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md)* for a [component](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/component.md) of a [specific](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/specific.md) [system](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/system.md). 

*A rule* is a [norm](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/norm.md) which either (1) *happens [automatically](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/automate.md)* or (2) is *[strictly](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/strict.md) [required](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/require.md) in a specific [policy](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/policy.md).*

#### Notes
Rules are distinguished from [guidelines](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/guideline.md) by the fact that *[agents](https://github.com/gcassel/Modular-Organization-Terminology/blob/master/terms/agent.md) mutually agree to enforce rules*.  (If rules aren't enforced or enforceable, they're actually "just" guidelines-- and faux rules can unfairly inhibit the most cooperative and considerate people in a project or community.)
